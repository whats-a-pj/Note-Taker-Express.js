I had a study group with Brian Whisler, Jeremy Rapich and Salvador Mejia on 9/3 where we went over Express.js and a bit of SQL.

Also had help from TA's CJ Sanders, Trever Oveson and Jacek Hacking, surprised to find out all I really needed to do was change a single line of code to get everything up and running!
